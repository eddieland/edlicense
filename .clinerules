# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.clinerules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- You can use the existing addlicense code base as a reference from ./ref/addlicense to find out what features it has and how our interface should be structured.
- For CLI interfaces:
  - We prefer long options except for very-well known arguments, since they're easier to understand in pipelines
  - We use --options-like-this, not --options_like_this

## Cursor learned

- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
